##  ON WRITING UTENSILS

Black ink is to be used, with no exceptions for other colors. Pens with particularly strong, dark ink are preferred, for example the Pilot G2 or Sharpie Roller 05. Pencils, ideally small, hard mechanical penciles such as ones using 0.3mm lead in the HB hardness (or harder) may be used for layout, but ought to be inked in using a pen. A selection of pens to accomodate a selection of line weights is recommended for inking in a mechanical drawing.

## ON FORMATTING OF ENTRIES

The standard distance for indenting (such as at the beginning of a paragraph) is 10 millimeters (2 squares). 

A diagram, schematic, table, or pictorial set into the text requires 5 millimeters (1 square) of padding on its left, top, and right sides, and 15 millimeters (3 squares) on the bottom side, to accomodate a subtitle / Figure number with 5 millimeters (1 square) above and below. If any side of the inset object borders on the edge of the dotted area of the page, 5 millimeters (1 square) of padding on that side may be omitted.

A paragraph break requires 5mm (1 square) of empty space between lines of text. The first line of the new paragraph must be indented.

Titles, such as entry titles, must have 5mm (1 square) of empty space between them and the following line of text. ISHS headers receive the same empty row.
